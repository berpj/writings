# My 2015 reading list (and how to keep track of books)

Starting in July, I have decided to read at least a book every two weeks. I choose them in various categories, such as engineering, business, sci-fi or biographies.

*On a side note, this bookshelf picture is very ironic. I got rid of my physical bookshelf and most of my books a few weeks ago, and bought [a Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/All-New-Kindle-Paperwhite-High-Resolution-Display/dp/B00OQVZDJM). For 120$ you can have all your books at hand, wherever you are, and get a better user experience (backlight, translator, dictionary, etc.). Moreover, with the current prices, you can expect this device to pay for itself in about 20 books.*

### How to keep track of your books

A good way to save and sort your titles is to use Trello. Originally designed as a project management tool, it is now used for all sorts of things.

To illustrate how it can be done, I have created [a board](https://trello.com/b/pAGGTvwK/books) with the above books:

Yes, it is my actual list, updated in real-time. As you can see, I created three main columns: *To read* / *Current book* / *Done*. I then simply added a card for each book in the various columns and attached cover pictures.

It lets you have a good overview of where you are in your reading list.

I hope you could find some interesting readings in that list, and may be some ideas on how to manage your books.
