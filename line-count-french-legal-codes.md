A few weeks ago I created a Ruby script that counts the number of lines of a Github repository and makes a graph of it. You can find this project [here](https://github.com/berpj/graph-git).

It was originally intended to graph technical projects, but what if we apply it to a repository containing the [french legal codes](https://github.com/steeve/france.code-civil)?

It's what I did, and here is the result for the civil code:

And for all french legal codes:

*And it's only counting the lines since 1970.*

> Overall, more than 2 million lines were added to french legal codes during the last 45 years.

Interesting results, isn't it?
