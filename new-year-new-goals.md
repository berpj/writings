Happy New Year to you!

**The beginning of a new year is a great opportunity to set new goals for yourself.**

For 2015, one of my goals (or should I say personal challenges) is to blog.

I think it’s a great way to keep track of what you do and think, and a good opportunity to discuss with interesting people.

I plan to write about what I’m most interested in (of course!): Internet, web development and startups.

**By the way, I’d very interested to know how you are planning to challenge yourself this year. :)**
